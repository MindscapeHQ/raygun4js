# Vite for raygun4ja experiment notes

Using this guide: https://onderonur.netlify.app/blog/creating-a-typescript-library-with-vite/




## Bumping versions


``` bash

npm version patch
# Bumps the patch number like 0.0.0 -> 0.0.1
npm version minor
# Bumps the patch number like 0.0.x -> 0.1.0
npm version major
# Bumps the patch number like 0.x.y -> 1.0.0

```

We can also use alpha or beta versions. [npm version Docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-version) is a nice place to check out for it.
